    "- This is our best (point) estimate of the expected yearly increase in profit associated with a 1.38-month increase in crew tenure.\n",

    "\n",
    "- This means with 95\\% probability, we cannot rule out that the true impact of an increase of 1.38-month crew tenure on the (yearly) profit is as low as \\\\$142.21 and as high as \\\\$2465.92, a fairly wide range.\n",

    "- Converting these to the quarterly profit level, we have the 95% confidence interval of 0.25*(142.21, 2465.92) = (35.55, 616.48).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weighing the cost and the benefit to the firm, if the average quarterly bonus for those managers increasing CTenure by 1.38 during the quarter is below \\\\$35.55, we can conclude that the recent store manager bonus plan is likely a successful one using a 5% significance level (if it's above \\\\$616.48 then not a successful one).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the average quarterly bonus for those managers increasing CTenure by 1.38 during the quarter is between (35.55, 616.48), we cannot conclusively determine (statistically speaking) whether the recent bonus plan is a successful or not a successful one.\n",
