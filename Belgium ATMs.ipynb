    "This is the first homework assignment for GBA464 Programming for Analytics. Here, we will read and analyze a dataset on the number of ATMs in each market and some withdrawal measures. We have not learned to work with Pandas yet. So we we will work with NumPy and a dataset in the form of a list, where each element in the list is a column name:column value pair. See Exercise 1 in the NumPy lecture notes for a similar data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the assignment, you should:\n",
    "1. Make sure your Pandas and NumPy are installed correctly. We have installed NumPy in the first week. In the same manner, install Pandas using `pip install pandas` (or `conda install pandas`) in the Terminal/Anaconda Prompt.\n",
    "2. Follow the notebook and complete each question. Do not alter my code in Section 0 (\"General description and preparation steps\"). \n",
    "3. When your code is finished, clear all outputs and select \"run all\" to do a full run. Then check and confirm there is no error, and all outputs are as intended. \n",
    "4. Submit the finished notebook on Blackboard. Do this before the submission deadline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grading is based on completion. So make a genuine programming attempt in completing each question. Do not \"hard code\" your answer. For example, the number of rows in the data is 659, and the number of nonmissing rows is 310. Do **not** code `nrows = 659` and `nrows_nonmissing = 310` and use them as answers. "

    "This was a really tricky question. The intent was simple: check types. At the time of making the question, I didn't realize at the time that `.dtype == \"str\"` doesn't work as intended. Of course I realized this before I release the assignment, but I chose to keep the question because we can always find \"work arounds.\" See above, where I avoided checking strings. \n",

    "A quick-ish answer is that strings have many specific types, and these are related to their encoding. If we see dtype is \"U<11\" that means we have Unicode strings up to 11 characters. But there are other string encodings, such as \"ASCII.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to tackle this head-on is to use `np.issubdtype()` to get True's for something that is a subtype of the broader family of NumPy strings, `np.str_`. We can also change the \"int\" and \"bool\" to be NumPy versions of these types.  \n"
